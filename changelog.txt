-- Notes for 0.1 -- 2006-08-03

I, Cameron, downloaded the en-AU dictionary file from http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html in order to package it correctly for use in Mozilla applications and distribution through addons.mozilla.org. It was last modified on 2003-03-29. I received no reply after emailing the author, and such have decided to make my own fork (is it still a fork if the previous one isn't maintained?) for Mozilla :) I have also decided to change the license to the GNU General Public License - as per section 3 of the LGPL. 

The en_AU dictionary is credited to Kelvin Eldridge (previous maintainer) <audictionary@onlineconnections.com.au>, Jean Hollis Weber and David Wilson (originally licensed under the LGPL.)

Their changes:
- Words incorrect in Australian English removed
- a list from the previously removed words with corrected spelling was added
- a list of major rivers was added
- a list of place names was added
- a list of Australian mammals was added 
- a list of Aboriginal/Koori words commonly used was added

This dictionary was based on the en_GB dictionary, edited by David Bartlett, Brian Kelk and Andrew Brown - (originally licensed under the LGPL.)

Which was in turn initially based on a subset of the original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell and Aspell - (originally licensed under the LGPL.)

Original affix file created completely from scratch by David Bartlett and Andrew Brown, based on the published rules for MySpell - (originally licensed under the LGPL.)
