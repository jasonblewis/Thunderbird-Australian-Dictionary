This dictionary was based on the Australian English Dictionary available from http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html (Licensed under the LGPL.) In turn, that dictionary was based on the en_GB Myspell dictionary which in turn was initially based on a subset of the original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for Pspell and Aspell (also initially licensed under the LGPL.)
